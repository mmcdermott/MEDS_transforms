    """Performs pre-MEDS data wrangling for eICU.

    Inputs are the raw eICU files, read from the `raw_cohort_dir` config parameter. Output files are either
    symlinked (if they are not modified) or written in processed form to the `MEDS_input_dir` config
    parameter. Hydra is used to manage configuration parameters and logging.

    Note that eICU has only a tentative ability to identify true relative admission times for even the same
    patient, as health system stay IDs are only temporally ordered at the *year* level. As such, to properly
    parse this dataset in a longitudinal form, you must do one of the following:
      1. Not operate at the level of patients at all, but instead at the level of health system stays, as
         individual events within a health system stay can be well ordered.
      2. Restrict the analysis to only patients who do not have multiple health system stays within a single
         year (as health system stays across years can be well ordered, provided we assume to distinct stays
         within a single health system cannot overlap).

    In this pipeline, we choose to operate at the level of health system stays, as this is the most general
    approach. The only downside is that we lose the ability to track individual patients across health system
    stays, and thus can only explore questions of limited longitudinal scope.

    We ignore the following tables for the given reasons:
      1. `admissiondrug`: This table is noted in the
         [documentation](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/eicutables/admissiondrug/) as being "Extremely infrequently
         used".
      2. `apacheApsVar`: This table is a sort of "meta-table" that contains variables used to compute the
         APACHE score; we won't use these raw variables from this table, but instead will use the raw data.
      3. `apachePatientResult`: This table has pre-computed APACHE score variables; we won't use these and
         will use the raw data directly.
      4. `apachePredVar`: This table contains variables used to compute the APACHE score; we won't use these
         in favor of the raw data directly.
      5. `carePlanCareProvider`: This table contains information about the provider for given care-plan
         entries; however, as we can't link this table to the particular care-plan entries, we don't use it
         here. It also is not clear (to the author of this script; the eICU team may know more) how reliable
         the time-offsets are for this table as they merely denote when a provider was entered into the care
         plan.
      6. `customLab`: The documentation for this table is very sparse, so we skip it.
      7. `intakeOutput`: There are a number of significant warnings about duplicates, cumulative values, and
         more in the documentation for this table, so for now we skip it.
      8. `microLab`: We don't use this because the culture taken time != culture result time, so seeing this
         data would give a model an advantage over any possible real-world implementation. Plus, the docs say
         it is not well populated.
      9. `note`: This table is largely duplicated with structured data due to the fact that primarily
         narrative notes were removed due to PHI constraints (see the docs).

    There are other notes for this pipeline:
      1. Many fields here are, I believe, **lists**, not simple categoricals, and should be split and
         processed accordingly. This is not yet done.

    Args (all as part of the config file):
        raw_cohort_dir: The directory containing the raw eICU files.
        output_dir: The directory to write the processed files to.
