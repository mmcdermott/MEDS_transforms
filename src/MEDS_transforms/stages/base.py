class Stage:
    """The representation of a MEDS-Transforms stage, in object form.

    Largely speaking, this is just a container around the different component functions that are used to
    execute the stage, as well as stage specific metadata like the name, docstring, and type.

    When constructed through the decorator `Stage.register`, it will be set to mimic in usage the function
    being decorated, though will still be a Stage object. This is done through the use of the `__call__`
    operator, and ensures that things like doctests and imports of the function being decorated do not behave
    unexpectedly. When constructed through the `Stage` constructor directly or through non-decorator usage,
    instead, the `__call__` operator will point to the main function of the stage. This enables two styles of
    usage; one where a map or compute function is decorated, but if the resulting function is imported or used
    in doctests it will behave like the decorated function, and the main callable for the stage is only
    accessible in the `main` variable of the stage object, and the second where a stage is constructed
    manually and (typically) assigned to a `main` variable in a stage python script or equivalent.

    This class is usually created through the `Stage.register` method -- either as a decorator, or as a
    function directly called. See the examples below for more details.

    Calling `print` on a `Stage` object will display a simple method indicating the name of the stage, the
    global stage docstring, and the names of the main, map, reduce, and mimic functions, if set. This is
    largely for testing and debugging purposes, and is not intended to be used in production code.

    Static data examples can also be attached to the stage object, to enable automated testing and
    documentation of the stage. This is managed through the `examples_dir` attribute, which can be passed in
    upon construction. When constructed through the `Stage.register` function, which is the typical usage, if
    unspecified this will automatically be set in accordance with the following rules:
      1. If the location in which `Stage.register` is called lives in a directory of the same name as the
         stage being defined _and_ has a subdirectory called `examples`, then that directory will be used.
      2. Otherwise, it will remain unset and no examples will be attached.
    If you would like additional modes of default inference to be added (such as on the basis of the locations
    in which the passed functions are defined) please file a GitHub Issue.

    Attributes:
        stage_type: The type of stage this is. This is set automatically based on the provided functions. See
            `StageType` for more details.
        stage_name: The name of the stage. This is set automatically based on the provided functions or can be
            set manually.
        stage_docstring: The docstring of the stage. This is set automatically based on the provided functions
            or can be set manually.
        map_fn: The mapping function for the stage. This is set automatically based on the provided functions.
            May be None for a `StageType.MAIN` stage.
        reduce_fn: The reducing function for the stage. This is set automatically based on the provided
            functions. May be None for a `StageType.MAP` or `StageType.MAIN` stage.
        main_fn: The main function for the stage. This is set automatically based on the provided functions.
        examples_dir: A directory containing nested test cases for the stage.
            If not set, this is automatically inferred in the case that the stage name and registering file
            conform to the pattern mentioned above.
        output_schema_updates: A dictionary mapping column name to a Polars type for the output of the stage,
            with the base MEDS schema options as defaults for unspecified columns.

    Examples:

    Most of the examples shown here are focused on more internal aspects of how stages work; for documentation
    on how you will most likely use stages, see the documentation for the `Stage.register` function.

    Stages come with tracked test cases. If no special parameters are set on the command line, they won't be
    tracked:

        >>> Stage.ERR_IF_ENTRY_POINT_IMPORTABLE = False
        >>> def main(cfg: DictConfig):
        ...     '''base main docstring'''
        ...     return "main"
        >>> stage = Stage(main_fn=main)
        >>> print(stage.examples_dir)
        None
        >>> stage.test_cases
        {}

    The test cases are inferred through the `examples_dir` attribute. This can be set manually:

        >>> stage = Stage(main_fn=main, examples_dir=Path("foo"))
        >>> print(stage.examples_dir)
        foo

    But the test cases will only exist if the directory is properly set up:

        >>> stage.test_cases
        {}

    Proper set-up means the directory is or has any children that satisfy the `StageExample.is_example_dir`
    method.

        ...     example_dir = Path(tmpdir) / "examples"

    The examples directory can also be inferred via a passed `_calling_file` argument, which is intended to be
    the file in which the `Stage.register` function was called. This looks to see if (1) the calling file
    lives in a parent directory of the same name as the defining stage and (2) if that directory has an
    `examples` subdirectory. If so, this subdirectory is et to the examples directory. Otherwise, nothing is
    set.

        >>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        ...     stage_dir = Path(tmpdir) / "stage_foo"
        ...     calling_file = stage_dir / "stage_foo.py"
        ...     examples_dir = stage_dir / "examples"
        ...     examples_dir.mkdir(parents=True)
        ...     calling_file.touch()
        ...     stage = Stage(main_fn=main, stage_name="stage_foo", _calling_file=calling_file)
        ...     print(stage.examples_dir.relative_to(tmpdir))
        stage_foo/examples

    If the stage name doesn't match the directory name, we won't infer `self.examples_dir`:

        >>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        ...     stage_dir = Path(tmpdir) / "stage_foo"
        ...     calling_file = stage_dir / "stage_foo.py"
        ...     examples_dir = stage_dir / "examples"
        ...     examples_dir.mkdir(parents=True)
        ...     calling_file.touch()
        ...     stage = Stage(main_fn=main, stage_name="not_stage_foo", _calling_file=calling_file)
        ...     print(stage.examples_dir)
        None

    If the examples directory doesn't exist, we won't infer `self.examples_dir`:

        >>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        ...     stage_dir = Path(tmpdir) / "stage_foo"

        ## Function usage modes:

        It can be used either as a decorator, a parametrized decorator, or a direct method, depending on the
        arguments provided and manner of invocation.

        ### As a decorator
        If used as a decorator (e.g., `@Stage.register`) on a single function, it will define a stage using
        that function. The stage defined will either be a `StageType.MAIN` stage if the function is named
        `main`, or a `StageType.MAP` stage otherwise. The return value will be a Stage object set to mimic the
        called function.

        ### As a parametrized decorator
        If used as a parametrized decorator (e.g., `@Stage.register(stage_name="foo")`), it will define a
        stage using the decorated function, but with the specified keyword arguments modifying the stage
        appropriately. The keyword arguments included can include any property save `main_fn` or `map_fn`. The
        stage will either be a `StageType.MAIN` stage if the function is named `main` (in which case a
        `reduce_fn` property cannot be set), a `StageType.MAP` stage if the decorated function is not named
        main and a `reduce_fn` is not set, or a `StageType.MAPREDUCE` stage if the decorated function is not
        named `main` and a `reduce_fn` is set. The return value will be a Stage object set to mimic the
        decorated function. If a `reduce_fn` is passed as a keyword argument, it will not be modified.

        ### As a direct method
        If used as a direct method, (e.g., `main = Stage.register(main_fn=main)`), it will define a stage
        using the provided arguments, and return the stage object. The returned object will not be set to
        mimic any function, and the `main` method will be the main entry point for the stage. This mode is
        only activated if sufficient keyword arguments are provided to define a stage (meaning a `main_fn` or
        `map_fn` must be set). The passed functions will not be modified.

        Args:
            *args: Positional arguments. If used as a decorator, this should be a single function, and no
                keyword arguments should be set.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments. These can include `main_fn`, `map_fn`, `reduce_fn`,
                `stage_name`, and `stage_docstring`. Other keyword arguments will cause an error. Not all
                keyword arguments are required for all usages of the decorator.

        ## Inference of static data examples:

        When this function is called, it will attempt to locate the filepath of the file in which it was
        called, and pass that as the `_calling_file` argument to the `Stage` constructor. This is used to
        infer the examples directory if it is not manually set. Note that this means that the parameter
        `_calling_file` can not be used as a keyword argument to this function. You should never need this
        parameter anyways, as if you are setting something manually you can directly set the example
        directory.

        Returns:
            Either a `Stage` object or a decorator function, depending on the arguments provided.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If multiple positional arguments are passed or if the function is not callable.
            TypeError: If the first positional argument is not a function.
            ValueError: If both `main_fn` and `map_fn` or `reduce_fn` are provided.

        Examples:

            Firstly, note that in normal usage, the Stage class raises a warning and/or errors if the stage is
            not registered properly in an entry point. We'll disable that and other error checking for most of
            the doctests here, then show it again at the end.

            >>> Stage.ERR_IF_ENTRY_POINT_IMPORTABLE = False

            When used with only keyword arguments that fully define a function a stage set to mimic nothing is
            returned directly, with the parameters set as defined by what kind of stage is being created.

            >>> def main(cfg: DictConfig):

              Reduce function: reduce_fn
              Main function: None
              Mimic function: None

            If you call it with main and map functions or a main and a reduce function, it will raise an
            error:

            >>> Stage.register(main_fn=main, map_fn=map_fn)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            ValueError: Only one of main_fn or map_fn/reduce_fn should be provided.
            >>> Stage.register(main_fn=main, reduce_fn=reduce_fn)

                ...
            ValueError: Only one of main_fn or map_fn/reduce_fn should be provided.

            You can also use it as a decorator:

            >>> @Stage.register
            ... def main(cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base main docstring'''
            ...     return "main"

            The output of the decorator, saved here to the variable `main`, will "mimic" the decorated
            function under normal usage:

            >>> main.__name__
            'main'
            >>> main.__doc__
            'base main docstring'
            >>> main({})
            'main'

            ... but it is actually a stage object defined by the decorator:

            >>> print(main)
            Stage base:
              Type: main
              Docstring:
                | base main docstring
              Map function: None
              Reduce function: None
              Main function: main
              Mimic function: main

            When used as a decorator, you can also parametrize the decorator:

            >>> @Stage.register(stage_name="foo", stage_docstring="bar")
            ... def main(cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base main docstring'''
            ...     return "main"
            >>> print(main)
            Stage foo:
              Type: main
              Docstring:
                | bar
              Map function: None
              Reduce function: None
              Main function: main
              Mimic function: main

            The decorated function will be inferred to be a "main" function if it is named "main" and there is
            no reduce function specified in the parametrized keyword arguments to the decorator. Otherwise, it
            will be assumed to be a map function:

            >>> @Stage.register
            ... def map_fn(cfg: DictConfig, stage_cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base map docstring'''
            ...     return "map"

              Docstring:
                | base map docstring

              Reduce function: None
              Main function: None
              Mimic function: map_fn
            >>> @Stage.register(reduce_fn=reduce_fn)

              Type: mapreduce
              Docstring:
                | Map Stage:

              Reduce function: reduce_fn
              Main function: None
              Mimic function: main

            You can't use it as a decorator while specifying either the main or map function in the keyword
            arguments:

            >>> @Stage.register(map_fn=map_fn)
            ... def reduce_fn(cfg: DictConfig, stage_cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base reduce docstring'''
            ...     return "reduce"
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            ValueError: If a Stage is constructed via keyword arguments directly (including a `main_fn` or a
            `map_fn`), then it cannot be used as a decorator or otherwise called directly.

            You also can't specify a positional argument and keyword arguments at the same time or multiple
            positional arguments:

            >>> stage = Stage.register(main, stage_name="foo")
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            ValueError: Cannot provide keyword arguments when using as a decorator.
            >>> stage = Stage.register(main, map_fn)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            ValueError: Stage.register can only be used with at most a single positional arg. Got 2

            Though not recommended, you could theoretically use decorator mode directly to create a function
            that would return a stage. This exposes some further error surfaces which are checked explicitly:

            >>> def main(cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base main docstring'''
            ...     return "main"
            >>> def map_fn(cfg: DictConfig, stage_cfg: DictConfig):
            ...     '''base map docstring'''
            ...     return "map"
            >>> manual_decorator = Stage.register(stage_name="foo", stage_docstring="bar")
            >>> print(manual_decorator(map_fn))
            Stage foo:
              Type: map
              Docstring:
                | bar

              Reduce function: None
              Main function: None
              Mimic function: map_fn
            >>> manual_decorator(main, map_fn=map_fn)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            ValueError: Cannot provide main_fn or map_fn kwargs when using as a decorator.
            >>> manual_decorator("foo")
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            TypeError: First argument must be a function. Got <class 'str'>

            The parameter `_calling_file` is used to infer the examples directory, and can't be set manually
            in the function.

            >>> Stage.register(_calling_file="foo")
            Traceback (most recent call last):

            ValueError: Cannot provide keyword arguments that are also automatically inferred. Got

            What about those warnings? To see the warnings in this test, we'll explicitly capture and print
            logged warnings. These will normally only be visible in the logger output, but we'll capture and
            print them here using the `print_warnings` context manager, defined in our `conftest.py` file.

            Warning: Stage 'base' is not registered in the entry points. This may be due to a missing or
            incorrectly configured entry point in your setup.py or pyproject.toml file. If this is during
            development, you may need to run `pip install -e .` to install your package properly in editable
            mode and ensure your stage registration is detected. You can disable this warning by setting the
            class variable `WARN_IF_NO_ENTRY_POINT_AT_NAME` to `False`, or filtering out
            `StageRegistrationWarning` warnings. You can disable all validation by setting the environment
            variable `DISABLE_STAGE_VALIDATION` to `1`.
